a.
  i.  The UI is composable because you can return a tree of components that you
      or someone else built. This is a key principle of maintainable frontends
  ii. JSX is precompiled into plain JavaScript and is generally easier to use
      than JS.
  iii.Comments are...
          loaded through the comment box from the server
          created from the comment react class
          saved using the commentForm class.
  iv. Props are immutable, where as states are mutable.
      States being mutable means we can implement interactions.

b.
  i.  Adding and removing comments from comments.json will add and remove
      comments from the webpage. This happens in two second intervals, when
      the page gets re-rendered.
